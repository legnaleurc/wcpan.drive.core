"""Core type definitions and abstract interfaces for cloud drive operations.

This module defines the foundational types, data structures, and abstract
interfaces that form the wcpan.drive.core API. All implementations must
adhere to these contracts.

Key Concepts:
    - Node: Immutable representation of files and directories
    - Drive: High-level interface for drive operations
    - FileService: Backend implementation for cloud storage APIs
    - SnapshotService: Local cache for node metadata
    - MediaInfo: Metadata for image and video files

The module follows a layered architecture:
    1. Drive (public API) - User-facing operations
    2. FileService + SnapshotService - Backend implementations
    3. Node + MediaInfo - Data representations

Thread Safety:
    All interfaces are designed for async/await usage. Implementations
    should handle concurrent access appropriately.

Example:
    Basic usage pattern::

        >>> async with create_drive(file=my_file_service, snapshot=my_snapshot) as drive:
        ...     root = await drive.get_root()
        ...     files = await drive.get_children(root)

    Node is the core data structure representing both files and directories.
    All attributes are immutable - to modify a node, use Drive methods which
    return new Node instances with updated values.

    Attributes:
        id: Unique identifier for this node assigned by the service.
        parent_id: ID of the parent directory, or None for root node.
        name: Name of the file or directory (without path).
        is_directory: True if this node represents a directory.
        is_trashed: True if this node is in the trash.
        ctime: Creation timestamp.
        mtime: Last modification timestamp.
        mime_type: MIME type string (e.g., "image/jpeg", "video/mp4").
        hash: Content hash for files, empty string for directories.
        size: File size in bytes, 0 for directories.
        is_image: True if this is an image file with media metadata.
        is_video: True if this is a video file with media metadata.
        width: Image/video width in pixels, 0 if not applicable.
        height: Image/video height in pixels, 0 if not applicable.
        ms_duration: Video duration in milliseconds, 0 if not applicable.
        private: Service-specific metadata, or None if not used.

        Node is frozen (immutable). To change properties, use Drive.move()

    SnapshotService defines the contract for maintaining a local cache of

    - Offline access to metadata

class Drive(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """High-level interface for cloud drive operations.

    Drive is the main user-facing API for interacting with cloud storage.
    It combines FileService (cloud API) and SnapshotService (local cache)
    to provide efficient, feature-rich operations.

    Key Features:
        - Path-based and ID-based node access
        - Directory traversal and tree walking
        - File upload/download with resumable support
        - Node manipulation (create, move, rename, delete)
        - Change synchronization
        - Trash management

    Usage Pattern:
        Create Drive instances using create_drive() as an async context manager.
        The Drive interface ensures proper initialization and cleanup.

    Authentication:
        Most operations require authentication. Use is_authenticated() to check
        and authenticate() to establish credentials.

    Thread Safety:
        Drive operations are async-safe but instances should not be shared
        across concurrent tasks without external synchronization.

        Basic usage pattern::
